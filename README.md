# MyCodeWars

This repository is for my completed Codewars challenges. I am starting by doing a first pass on 5-10 challenges before I go back to refactor.


Completed Challenges:

1. cw-0001 - "Stop gninnipS My sdroW!" 
  - Write a function that takes in a string of one or more words, and returns the same string, but with all five or more letter words reversed. Strings passed in will consist of only letters and spaces. Spaces will be included only when more than one word is present. 
2. cw-0002 - "Find The Parity Outlier"
  - You are given an array (which will have a length of at least 3, but could be very large) containing integers. The array is either entirely comprised of odd integers or entirely comprised of even integers except for a single integer N. Write a method that takes the array as an argument and returns this "outlier" N.
